        <h2>What is bruschetta?</h2>
        <p>Bruschetta (pronounced brew-SKET-tah) is an Italian appetizer or antipasti that starts with a base of toasted or grilled bread. The bread is then served warm either with a topping spooned over or with a topping on the side so each person can build their own bruschetta. Bruschetta is meant to be served as a hand-held finger food, large enough for one or two bites.</p>
